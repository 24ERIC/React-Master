# ReactMaster

# ðŸ¤”What is this?
This open source prebuild website sections on React by Material-Ui, the project provides open suorce code for the most frequently used sections in website develoopment process. By using the template in my project, future website developer can spent little time and effort to create an amazing React website.

# ðŸ’¡Motivation
During my many MLH hackathon in 2023, my teams can choose either develop a website ourself or use a website builder to build a website for us in order to present and demo our project. However, developing website ourself can be time-consuming, and third party softwares are not open source and not capable to connect with APIs. Therefore, my project is the solution to the problem!

# ðŸ˜ŽHow I did it?
I reference the close sourcec sections provided on [wix](wix.com), I select the right one by choosing the most representative and also less implementation repetitive sections. What I mean is some sections looks very differently, but the code structions and the librareis will be used are same, which are so-called "repeated section". 

# ðŸ¥¸What I learned?
I learned how to develop an app by React (Javascript), get to know what is JSX and JS, also how material-ui makes the React website developer's life easier!
